<h1> This is me learning <h1>
  Hi! Welcome to my journey to learn code
<br>
  This may be dumb but it will help me alot
<p>
      Heres what im learning:
    <br>
        The "< html >" tag tells the browser "hey contained in here is a bunch of HTML code."
        The "< head >" tag we don't really use just yet, but it will contain our references to outside bits of code such as CSS or Javascript.
        The "< body >" tag tells the browser "contained in here is the stuff I actually want you to show the user."
    <br>
  <p>
